# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials "JJ" to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder awaiting an assigned (or defined) value. An argument is the content (or information) that adds (or passes) value to the function declaration when invoked (or run, called, or executed).

Researched answer: A parameter is a placeholder of an argument in a function declaration. Once a value is given, it (or content as a datatype) is the argument that will be passed to run (or execute) the function.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: An object is a Javascript key-value pair. A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

Researched answer: An object is a property-method key-value pair that can express data and behavior (or action or a function). A class is the instruction (or blueprint) that governs how an object is expressed, using constructor, this, and new. ("Constructor" is a special method that creates and initialize objects.
"This" is a keyword that specifies an object. "New" creates an object--the instance (or occurrence) of a class.)

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: An iteration is an invoked cycle or repeated execution of a function.

Researched answer: An iteration is the process of repeating an action until a condition is met. 

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: Hoisting is an action (or behavior) that interprets (or uses) variables and functions before they are declared in the code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State: the storage of data in a React component.

2. React Props: like a handshake or a stream, props (or properties) passes data from one component to another. 

3. JSX: an HTML-like markdown (or lightweight markup language) that allows React to create UIs.
